#Oculie

#Oculie is a loosely coupled framework used mainly for personal projects. It's quite experimental and created mostly for curiosity. Most part of it probably won't appear here (because of lame code). Nonetheless, some parts of code that come from other project may appear here (since those are not really mine) with some change (since there is no point de create some unchanged code repositories). All credit goes to originals contributors !
